# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book with Integrated RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
Validate all technical content via simulations, ROS2, NVIDIA Isaac, and authoritative sources

### Clarity
Content must be suitable for advanced AI & robotics students

### Reproducibility
All code, simulations, and demos must run as documented

### Integration
Book content and RAG chatbot aligned; chatbot answers based on selected text

### Practicality
Focus on hands-on humanoid robot applications bridging digital AI and physical embodiment

### Quality Assurance
All content and code continuously synced with GitHub repo

## Key Standards
Include diagrams, step-by-step explanations, and code examples; Minimum 50% peer-reviewed or official sources (ROS2, NVIDIA Isaac, Unity); Chatbot answers traceable to book content; Writing style: Flesch-Kincaid 12–14; Plagiarism: 0% tolerance

## Constraints
Docusaurus book deployed to GitHub Pages with embedded RAG chatbot; Modules: ROS2 (Robotic Nervous System), Gazebo & Unity (Digital Twin), NVIDIA Isaac (AI-Robot Brain), Vision-Language-Action (VLA); Capstone: autonomous humanoid robot performing voice-to-action tasks, obstacle navigation, and object manipulation; Word count: 50,000–70,000 words; Include all code, simulations, and notebooks in GitHub repo with instructions

## Governance
GitHub Integration: Repository: https://github.com/Areejshaikh/Physical_AI_-_Humanoid_Robotics.git; All code, notebooks, diagrams, and book content must be automatically pushed/updated to this repository; Maintain proper folder structure: /book-content, /simulations, /notebooks, /RAG-chatbot; Commits must be descriptive, organized, and maintain reproducibility
